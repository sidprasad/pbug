# PBug
## Siddhartha Prasad

PBug is a parser generator language which auto generates a parser-debugger.
While it is designed to work with LL(1) and SLR parsers, the current implementation generates a top-down parser. PBug is embedded in Haskell.

PBug was written for an independent study at Tufts University, under the supervision of Kathleen Fisher.
